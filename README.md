## 👋 Hey there, I'm X_12 (aka X12-Cloud)

Welcome to my corner of GitHub. I’m a curious soul who dives deep into code, systems, and how everything works under the hood. Currently building things that combine tech, AI, and Geometry Dash.

### 🚀 What I'm Up To

- 🔧 Low-level programming — building a compiler in C++ from scratch
- 🧠 Experimenting with AI models and neural networks in Python (TensorFlow gang 🧪)
- 🖥️ Making cross-platform apps that feel native and fast
- 🌐 Exploring browser internals and custom web tech
- 🎮 Playing GD

---

### 🧰 My Toolbox

- **Languages:** C++, Java, Python, Bash, JavaScript
- **Tools:** Neovim (LazyVim ⚡), JetBrains IDEs, Trae AI Editor, Linux (Arch btw), Git
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow, NumPy, scikit-learn
- **UI Stuff:** Figma, TailwindCSS, Pixel Art

### 🏗️ Working On / Learning
- **Compiler:** A compiler made purly in C++ no tools used just pure code
- **AI/ML:** Making and Learning Deep Learningg models and neural networks 
- **Languages Learning:** C++, Java

### 🤝 Let's Collaborate

Got something cool in mind? I'm open to:
- 🤖 Building AI-powered tools
- 🛠️ Optimizing low-level systems
- 🎨 Creating stunning UIs in code ofc

## 👋 Hey there, I'm X_12 (aka X12-Cloud)

Welcome to my corner of GitHub. I’m a curious soul who dives deep into code, systems, and how everything works under the hood. Currently building things that combine tech, AI, and Geometry Dash.

### 🚀 What I'm Up To

- 🔧 Low-level programming — building a compiler in C++ from scratch  
- 🧠 Experimenting with AI models and neural networks in Python (TensorFlow, NumPy)  
- 🎮 Playing Geometry Dash — sometimes modding it too  
- 🖥️ Trying to understand what happens between keypress and kernel
